    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Mexico City's transit system represents one of the most comprehensive urban mobility networks in the Americas, serving millions of daily passengers across the sprawling metropolitan area.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Mexico City’s high-capacity transit anchors daily life at a metropolitan scale. The Metro—one of the busiest systems in the Americas—links distant neighborhoods through fast, grade-separated service, while Metrobús extends high-reliability corridors along the surface, knitting together hubs, jobs, and services. Together they shape flows of people, place, and possibility.</p>

        <h2>Metro: Origins</h2>
        <p>Opened in 1969 with an initial set of centrally focused stations, the Metro was designed to tame congestion and support a rapidly growing capital. Color-coded lines and distinctive station pictograms simplified wayfinding and quickly became part of the city’s visual identity. Rubber-tired trains—well-suited to steeper gradients and tighter curves—enabled fast expansion through the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

      <article class="slide" id="metro-today-upgrades">
        <h2>Metro: Today & Upgrades</h2>
        <p>Today the Metro spans a dozen lines and nearly two hundred stations, providing frequent service from early morning until midnight across key radial and cross-town corridors. Recent investment has focused on modernizing core infrastructure—overhauling track, power, and stations; renewing rolling stock; and improving operations on the busiest lines—to stabilize service and reduce delay. Upgrades to wayfinding, lighting, and passenger information aim to make complex transfers more legible and reliable.</p>

        <h2>Metro: Rider Experience & Safety</h2>
        <p>Crowded peaks and long interchanges define many commuter journeys, but station redesigns, platform management, and targeted crowd control can ease pinch points. Safety initiatives—ranging from improved lighting and CCTV to staffed areas and women-and-children-priority spaces—seek to address harassment and enhance perceived and actual safety. Better ventilation, escalator maintenance, and platform edge markings also contribute to a more comfortable rider experience.</p>

      <article class="slide" id="metrobus-origins">
        <h2>Metrobús: Origins</h2>
        <p>Launched in 2005, Metrobús introduced center-running busways with off-board fare collection and level boarding, delivering “metro-like” reliability at street level. The first corridors targeted high-demand arterials where buses previously competed with mixed traffic; stations were designed for quick dwell times and seamless transfers to the Metro, cycling networks, and walkable district centers.</p>

      <article class="slide" id="metrobus-growth-electrification">
        <h2>Metrobús: Growth & Electrification</h2>
        <p>Over time, Metrobús expanded along multiple corridors to connect major hubs—the historic center, Reforma, and key intermodal stations—with airport access via dedicated alignments. Fleet renewal emphasizes higher-capacity articulated vehicles and a growing share of zero-emission buses. Planned extensions and orbital links aim to relieve pressure on radial routes, shorten crosstown trips, and cut tailpipe emissions along the city’s busiest roads.</p>

      <article class="slide" id="integration-fares">
        <h2>Integration: Fares, Transfers, and the MI Card</h2>
        <p>A unified contactless card system and increasingly coordinated timetables simplify interchanges between Metro, Metrobús, and other modes. Clearer wayfinding at shared stations, shaded and traffic-calmed walking links, and bike parking expand the reach of each corridor. As more services align fare media and transfer policies, door-to-door trips become faster, more predictable, and easier to plan.</p>

      <article class="slide" id="equity-access">
        <h2>Equity & Access</h2>
        <p>High-capacity transit can widen opportunity by shrinking travel times to jobs and schools, but many peripheral neighborhoods remain beyond comfortable walking distance. Priority projects focus on first-/last-mile connections—safer crossings, improved sidewalks, feeder buses, and bike links—so riders do not face a “last barrier” between home and the network. Accessibility retrofits—ramps, elevators, tactile paving—help ensure the system works for all ages and abilities.</p>

      <article class="slide" id="climate-public-space">
        <h2>Climate & Public Space</h2>
        <p>Mode shift from cars to Metro and Metrobús lowers corridor emissions, reduces congestion, and frees street space for safer walking and cycling. Streetscape upgrades around stations—trees, shade, seating, and stormwater features—create cooler microclimates and more dignified waiting areas. As fleets transition toward cleaner propulsion, operational emissions fall while air quality improves along high-traffic avenues.</p>

      <article class="slide" id="resilience-maintenance">
        <h2>Operations, Resilience & Maintenance</h2>
        <p>Keeping a megacity moving depends on core basics: preventative maintenance, parts availability, and incident response. Investments in power redundancy, drainage, and monitoring systems help the network cope with heavy rains and service disruptions. Transparent performance reporting and rider feedback loops build trust, guiding targeted fixes where they matter most.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="slide" id="whats-next">
        <h2>What’s Next</h2>
        <p>The next chapter emphasizes reliable core service, zero-emission surface fleets, and equitable coverage in underserved areas. Completing orbital links, strengthening interchanges, and upgrading stations will unlock faster cross-city travel while supporting safer streets and more vibrant public spaces. Metro plus Metrobús—reinforced by walking and cycling—form the backbone of a healthier, more connected, and more resilient Mexico City.</p>
