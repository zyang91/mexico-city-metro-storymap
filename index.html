        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Mexico City’s high-capacity transit anchors daily life at a metropolitan scale. The Metro—one of the busiest systems in the Americas—links distant neighborhoods through fast, grade-separated service, while Metrobús extends high-reliability corridors along the surface, knitting together hubs, jobs, and services. Together they shape flows of people, place, and possibility.</p>

        <h2>Metro: <span class="header-emph"> Origin</span></h2>
        <p>Opened in 1969 with an initial set of centrally focused stations, the Metro was designed to tame congestion and support a rapidly growing capital. Color-coded lines and distinctive station pictograms simplified wayfinding and quickly became part of the city’s visual identity. Rubber-tired trains—well-suited to steeper gradients and tighter curves—enabled fast expansion through the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

        <h2>Metro:<span class="header-emph">Today & Upgrades</span></h2>
        <p>Today the Metro spans a dozen lines and nearly two hundred stations, providing frequent service from early morning until midnight across key radial and cross-town corridors. </p>
        <p>Recent investment has focused on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Modernizing core infrastructure: <span class="li-explain">overhauling track, power, and stations</span></li>
          <li>Renewing rolling stock </li>
          <li>Improving operations <span class="li-explain">on the busiest lines—to stabilize service and reduce delay</span> </li>
          <li>upgrades to wayfinding, lighting, and passenger information <span class="li-explain">to make complex transfers more legible and reliable</span> </li>

        <h2>Metro: <span class="header-emph">Rider Experience & Safety</span></h2>
        <p>Crowded peaks and long interchanges define many commuter journeys, but station redesigns, platform management, and targeted crowd control can ease pinch points. </p>
        <p>Recently, Mexico City Metro launched many safety initiatives ranged from improved lighting and CCTV to increased police presents around staffed areas during peak hours to address harassment and enhance perceived and actual safety. </p>
        <p>In addition, Mexico City Metro also improve their system on ventilation, escalator, and platform edge, which also contribute to a more comfortable rider experience.</p>

      <article class="slide" id="metrobus-origins">
        <h2>Metrobús: <span class="header-emph">Origins</span></h2>
        <p>Launched in 2005, Metrobús introduced center-running busways with off-board fare collection and level boarding, delivering “metro-like” reliability at street level. 
          The first corridors targeted high-demand arterials where buses previously competed with mixed traffic. 
          Stations were designed for quick dwell times and seamless transfers to the Metro, cycling networks, and walkable district centers.</p>

      <article class="slide" id="metrobus-growth-electrification">
        <h2>Metrobús: <span class="header-emph">Growth & Electrification</span></h2>
        <p>Over time, Metrobús expanded along multiple corridors to connect major hubs—the historic center, Reforma, and key intermodal stations—with airport access via dedicated alignments. Fleet renewal emphasizes higher-capacity articulated vehicles and a growing share of zero-emission buses. Planned extensions and orbital links aim to relieve pressure on radial routes, shorten crosstown trips, and cut tailpipe emissions along the city’s busiest roads.</p>

        <h2>Integration: <span class="header-emph">Transfers and the MI Card</span></h2>
        <p>A unified contactless card system and increasingly coordinated timetables simplify interchanges between Metro, Metrobús, and other modes. 
          Clearer wayfinding at shared stations, shaded and traffic-calmed walking links, and bike parking expand the reach of each corridor. 
          As more services align fare media and transfer policies, door-to-door trips become faster, predictable, and easier to plan.</p>

      <article class="slide" id="equity-access">
        <h2>Equity & Access</h2>
        <p>High-capacity transit can widen opportunity by shrinking travel times to jobs and schools, but many peripheral neighborhoods remain beyond comfortable walking distance. 
          Priority projects should focus on first-/last-mile connections. Safer crossings, improved sidewalks, feeder buses, and bike links is crucial to maximum the capacity and potential for mass transit. 
          So riders do not face a “last barrier” between home and the network. 
          Accessibility retrofits—ramps, elevators, tactile paving—help ensure the system works for all ages and abilities.</p>

      <article class="slide" id="climate-public-space">
        <h2>Climate & Public Space</h2>
        <p>Mode shift from cars to Metro and Metrobús lowers carbon emissions, reduces congestion, and frees street space for safer walking and cycling. 
          Streetscape around stations such as trees, shade, seating, and storm water management features, create cooler microclimates and dignified the waiting areas. 
          As fleets transition toward cleaner propulsion, operational emissions fall while air quality improves along high-traffic avenues.</p>

      <article class="slide" id="resilience-maintenance">
        <h2>Operations, Resilience & Maintenance</h2>
        <p>Keeping a megacity moving depends on core basics: preventative maintenance, parts availability, and incident response. 
          Investments in power redundancy, drainage, and monitoring systems help the network cope with heavy rains and service disruptions. 
          Transparent performance reporting and rider feedback loops build trust, guiding targeted fixes where they matter most.</p>

      <article class="slide" id="whats-next">
        <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
        <p>The next chapter emphasizes reliable core service, zero-emission surface fleets, and equitable coverage in underserved areas. Completing orbital links, strengthening interchanges, and upgrading stations will unlock faster cross-city travel while supporting safer streets and more vibrant public spaces. Metro plus Metrobús—reinforced by walking and cycling—form the backbone of a healthier, more connected, and more resilient Mexico City.</p>
